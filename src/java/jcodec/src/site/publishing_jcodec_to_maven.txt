    http://blog.sonatype.com/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/#.VEq0WIvF-8E

[1] Download a version of jcodec you want to build
    git clone https://github.com/jcodec/jcodec.git

[2] Go inside jcodec folder and execute:
    mvn clean install
    mvn javadoc:jar gpg:sign
    mvn source:jar gpg:sign

[3] Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/
    [3.1]  Log in
    [3.2]  Go to 'Staging Upload'
    [3.3]  Under Upload Mode select 'Artifact(s) with a POM'
    [3.4]  Select 'pom' from jcodec/target
    [3.5]  In Select Artifacts to upload upload the following artifacts ( press Add Artifact for each file)
           jcodec-0.1.9.pom.asc
           jcodec-0.1.9.jar
           jcodec-0.1.9.jar.asc
           jcodec-0.1.9-javadoc.jar
           jcodec-0.1.9-javadoc.jar.asc
           jcodec-0.1.9-sources.jar
           jcodec-0.1.9-sources.jar.asc

    [3.5]  Fill in 'Description' field.
    [3.6]  Then press 'Upload artifacts'.
    [3.7]  Click on 'Staging Repositories' and find jcodec, it's normally the last one in the list.
    [3.8]  Verify that everything is fine and that the repository is closed ( no errors found ), 
	       check the 'Activity' tab. If something is wrong, fix it ( jcodecproject@gmail.com ).
    [3.9]  Click on 'Release' on the top of the page.
    [3.10] Fill in the drescription, press the button, it should say 'Repository is released'.

[4] The changes will be synced to main maven the next day or so.
